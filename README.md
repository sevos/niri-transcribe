# Niri Transcribe

A ChatGPT-style dictation system for Linux Wayland environments, providing session-based speech-to-text transcription with immediate text input to focused windows.

## üéØ Project Goals

- **Session-based speech recognition** with immediate text injection into active applications
- **Wayland-native integration** for seamless Linux desktop experience  
- **Docker-containerized deployment** for easy setup and consistent environments
- **Multiple transcription backends** (OpenAI Whisper API, local models)
- **User-controlled recording** with start/stop session management
- **Audio pipeline optimization** with session buffering and format conversion

## üöß Work in Progress

This project is currently under active development. Core audio capture functionality is implemented, with transcription services and UI components in progress.

**Current Status:** Session-Based Dictation Ready (Tickets 001-005, 012 complete)
