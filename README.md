# Niri Transcribe

A MacOS-like dictation system for Linux Wayland environments, providing real-time speech-to-text transcription with immediate text input to focused windows.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- **Real-time speech recognition** with immediate text injection into active applications
- **Wayland-native integration** for seamless Linux desktop experience  
- **Docker-containerized deployment** for easy setup and consistent environments
- **Multiple transcription backends** (OpenAI Whisper API, local models)
- **Voice Activity Detection** to automatically start/stop transcription
- **Audio pipeline optimization** with circular buffering and format conversion

## 🚧 Work in Progress

This project is currently under active development. Core audio capture functionality is implemented, with transcription services and UI components in progress.

**Current Status:** Audio Pipeline Ready (Tickets 001-003 complete)
