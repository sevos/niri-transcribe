# Niri Transcribe

A MacOS-like dictation system for Linux Wayland environments, providing real-time speech-to-text transcription with immediate text input to focused windows.

## üéØ Project Goals

- **Real-time speech recognition** with immediate text injection into active applications
- **Wayland-native integration** for seamless Linux desktop experience  
- **Docker-containerized deployment** for easy setup and consistent environments
- **Multiple transcription backends** (OpenAI Whisper API, local models)
- **Voice Activity Detection** to automatically start/stop transcription
- **Audio pipeline optimization** with circular buffering and format conversion

## üöß Work in Progress

This project is currently under active development. Core audio capture functionality is implemented, with transcription services and UI components in progress.

**Current Status:** Audio Pipeline Ready (Tickets 001-003 complete)

### üìñ Documentation
- **[Implementation Roadmap](docs/roadmap.md)** - Detailed project timeline, ticket dependencies, and progress tracking with actual vs estimated completion times
- **[Technology Stack](docs/technology-stack.md)** - Complete technical architecture overview including Node.js audio pipeline, Docker containerization, and integration strategies  
- **[Development Tickets](docs/tickets/)** - Individual implementation tickets with detailed specifications, requirements, and acceptance criteria
- **[QA Testing Plans](docs/qa/)** - Manual testing procedures, performance benchmarks, and verification protocols for implemented features

### ‚úÖ Completed Features
- Docker infrastructure with full audio stack access
- Real-time audio capture service with PipeWire/PulseAudio support
- JSON schema-based configuration system
