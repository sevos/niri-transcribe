# TICKET-012: Dictation System Simplification - QA Test Plan

## Overview
This document outlines comprehensive testing procedures for the simplified dictation system implemented in TICKET-012. The system has been refactored from a complex VAD-based chunking approach to a simple record-then-transcribe workflow.

## Key Changes Tested
- ✅ Removed VAD service (voice-activity-detector.js)
- ✅ Simplified audio capture from circular buffering to session-based recording
- ✅ Replaced real-time chunking with full session transcription
- ✅ Updated HTTP API for session control
- ✅ Removed VAD-related configuration options

## Prerequisites
- ✅ Docker environment with audio access
- ✅ OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable set
- ✅ Audio input device available
- ✅ Service running on port 3000

## Test Environment Setup

### 1. Environment Configuration
```bash
# Required for OpenAI transcription
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key-here"

# Optional: Enable debug logging
export DEBUG="true"

# Start simplified service
docker compose up --build
```

### 2. Verify Simplified Service Status
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:3000/health | jq
```

**Expected Changes**: No VAD-related metrics in health response

## Test Categories

## 1. Architecture Simplification Tests

### 1.1 Verify VAD Service Removal
**Objective**: Confirm VAD service and related code has been completely removed

**Steps**:
1. Check service health endpoint
2. Verify no VAD-related logs during startup
3. Confirm no VAD endpoints exist

**Test Commands**:
```bash
# Health check should not mention VAD
curl -s http://localhost:3000/health | jq '.services'

# These endpoints should not exist (404 expected)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/vad/start
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/vad/status
```

**Expected Results**:
- Health response contains no VAD references
- No VAD-related log messages during startup
- VAD endpoints return 404 Not Found
- Startup logs show simplified initialization

### 1.2 Configuration Simplification
**Objective**: Verify VAD-related configuration options removed

**Steps**:
1. Check configuration schema
2. Verify removed config options don't cause errors
3. Test new maxRecordingDuration setting

**Test Commands**:
```bash
# Check current configuration
curl -s http://localhost:3000/health | jq '.config'

# Configuration should not contain:
# - vadThreshold
# - chunkDuration  
# - silenceTimeout
# - bufferSize
```

**Expected Results**:
```json
{
  "config": {
    "audioDevice": "default",
    "transcriptionProvider": "auto",
    "serverPort": 3000,
    "debugEnabled": true
  }
}
```

## 2. New Session-Based Recording Tests

### 2.1 Basic Recording Session
**Objective**: Test new session-based recording workflow

**Steps**:
1. Start audio capture
2. Start recording session
3. Record audio for 3-5 seconds
4. Stop recording session
5. Verify transcription occurs

**Test Commands**:
```bash
# Ensure audio capture is running
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/audio/start

# Start recording session
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/recording/start
# Expected: {"status":"recording_started"}

# Check recording status
curl -s http://localhost:3000/recording/status | jq
# Expected: {"isRecording":true,"duration":X,"samples":Y}

# Speak into microphone for 3-5 seconds, then stop recording
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/recording/stop
# Expected: {"status":"recording_stopped","duration":X,"samples":Y}
```

**Expected Results**:
- Recording session starts without VAD checks
- Audio accumulates during entire recording session
- Transcription occurs only after explicit stop
- Logs show "Recording session started" and "Recording session stopped"
- Transcription result includes full session audio

### 2.2 Multiple Recording Sessions
**Objective**: Test multiple sequential recording sessions

**Steps**:
1. Complete first recording session
2. Wait for transcription to complete
3. Start second recording session
4. Verify clean session separation

**Test Commands**:
```bash
# First session
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/recording/start
# Speak: "This is the first recording"
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/recording/stop

# Wait for transcription logs

# Second session  
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/recording/start
# Speak: "This is the second recording"
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/recording/stop
```

**Expected Results**:
- Two separate transcription events in logs
- Each session shows correct duration and sample count
- No audio leakage between sessions
- Session buffer resets between recordings

### 2.3 Recording Status Monitoring
**Objective**: Test recording status API throughout session

**Steps**:
1. Monitor status before, during, and after recording
2. Verify duration and sample calculations
3. Test status during transcription

**Test Commands**:
```bash
# Before recording
curl -s http://localhost:3000/recording/status | jq

# Start recording and monitor
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/recording/start
curl -s http://localhost:3000/recording/status | jq

# During recording (repeat several times)
watch -n 1 'curl -s http://localhost:3000/recording/status | jq'

# After stopping
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/recording/stop
curl -s http://localhost:3000/recording/status | jq
```

**Expected Results**:
- Before: `{"isRecording":false,"duration":0,"samples":0}`
- During: `{"isRecording":true,"duration":increasing,"samples":increasing}`
- After: `{"isRecording":false,"duration":0,"samples":0}`
- Duration calculation accurate (samples / 16000)

## 3. Audio Quality and Performance Tests

### 3.1 Continuous Audio Capture Quality
**Objective**: Verify audio quality maintained without chunking

**Steps**:
1. Record 10-15 second audio session

# Test 30-second recording (approach max limit)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/recording/start
# Record for 30 seconds
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/recording/stop
```

**Expected Results**:
- Memory grows linearly with recording duration
- Memory released after transcription completes
- No memory leaks between sessions
- System remains stable with long recordings

### 3.3 Maximum Recording Duration Test
**Objective**: Test 5-minute maximum recording limit

**Steps**:
1. Start recording session
2. Let it run for 5+ minutes
3. Verify automatic stop behavior

**Test Commands**:
```bash
# Start long recording
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/recording/start

# Check status after 5+ minutes
curl -s http://localhost:3000/recording/status | jq
